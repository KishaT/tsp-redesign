# Beneficiary designation

If the statutory order of precedence below is acceptable, then you do NOT need to designate a beneficiary.

In the event of your death, the money in your beneficiary participant account (BPA) cannot remain in the TSP. Your the funds would be distributed as follows:

1. To your spouse
1. If none, to your child or children equally, with the share due any deceased child divided equally among that child’s descendants
1. If none, to your parents equally or to your surviving parent
1. If none, to the appointed executor or administrator of your estate
1. If none, to your next of kin who is entitled to your estate under the laws of the state in which you resided at the time of your death

If you decide you do not want your account distributed according to the order above, you’ll want to complete Form TSP-3, Designation of Beneficiary. The easiest way to do this is to use the online “wizard,” which you’ll find by logging into My Account and selecting “Beneficiaries” on the left.

## Notifying the TSP

In order for your beneficiaries to receive your account balance after your death, they (or their representatives) must complete the Form TSP-17, Information Relating to Deceased Participant, and submit it with a copy of the certified death certificate. Once we process the information and determine the beneficiaries for your account, we’ll contact them with additional information and instructions.

Death benefit payments made from your beneficiary participant account must be paid directly to your beneficiary(ies). These payments cannot be transferred or rolled over into an IRA or eligible employer plan. In addition, the payment will be fully taxable in the year your beneficiary(ies) receive it.

Your beneficiaries will not owe taxes on Roth contributions, qualified earnings on Roth contributions, and tax-exempt contributions in the account.

For more detailed information about the rules associated with death benefit payments, read the TSP tax notice "Important Tax Information About Thrift Savings Plan Death Benefit Payments." You may also want to consult a tax advisor.

## Beneficiary participant account distributions

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requires that you begin receiving distributions from your beneficiary participant account based on your life expectancy. The rules for when you must take Required Minimum Distributions depend in part on the deceased participant’s age on the date of his or her death.

Because the rules are complex, more specific information about the IRS required minimum distribution rules can be found in the tax notice Tax Information About TSP Withdrawals and Required Minimum Distributions for Beneficiary Participants.
