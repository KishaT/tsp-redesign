# Being a beneficiary participant?

If you’re the spouse beneficiary of a deceased participant's TSP account and your share of the balance is $200 or more, we’ve established a beneficiary participant account in your name. We’ll send you a "welcome letter" that provides your account and TSP benefits. Read it carefully and contact us immediately if any of your personal data included in the letter is incorrect.

As a beneficiary participant, you will not be able to make contributions to, borrow from, or transfer money into your beneficiary participant account (BPA); however, you can enjoy many of the same benefits as employee participants including:

- Low administrative expenses that can increase your savings potential
- Tax-deferred growth of earnings on traditional and Roth contributions
- Easy-to-understand investment options
- Staying in the TSP and choosing from several withdrawal options

To get the most out of the TSP, you need to make several important decisions about your account. Reading the booklet, Managing Your Account for Beneficiary Participants, will help you get started. For more in-depth information about your benefits and investment options, read Your TSP Account: A Guide for Beneficiary Participants.
