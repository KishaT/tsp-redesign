## Maximize your savings

When it comes to reaching your retirement goals, it’s important that you
maximize your savings. You can start by making sure you’re not leaving free
money on the table. Are you contributing enough to get at least the full match
from your agency or service?

Getting the full agency/service match is just the beginning. Increasing your
contributions each time you get a pay raise could increase your retirement
savings by tens of thousands over time.

Even as little 1% could make a big difference.
