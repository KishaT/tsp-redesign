Fund_name: S Fund
Fund_subtitle_line_1: Small cap stock
Fund_subtitle_line_2: Index investment fund
Fund_objective: The S Fund's investment objective is to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index, a broad market index made up of stocks of small-to-medium U.S. companies not included in the S&P 500 Index.
questions:
  - question: Why should I invest in the S Fund?
    answer: While investment in the S Fund carries risk, it also offers the opportunity to experience gains from equity ownership of small-to-mid-sized U.S. companies. It provides and excellent means of further diversifying your domestic equity holdings.
  - question: Am I ok with market and inflation risk?
    answer: There is a risk of loss if the Dow Jones U.S. Completion TSM Index declines in response to changes in overall economic conditions (market risk) or if the S Fund does not grow enough to offset the reduction in purchasing power (inflation risk).
  - question: How can I use the S Fund in my TSP?
    answer: The S Fund can be useful in a portfolio that also contains stock funds that track other indexes. The C, S, and I Funds, for example, track different segments of the overall stock market without overlapping. By investing in all segments of the stock market (as opposed to just one), you reduce your exposure to market risk.
