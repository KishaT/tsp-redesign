## Beneficiary basics

If you’d like your TSP account to be distributed according to the <span data-term="statutory order of precedence" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">statutory order of precedence</span>, you don’t have to do anything. In the event of your death, your TSP account would be paid as follows:

<ol>
<li>To your spouse</li>
<li>If none, to your child or children equally, with the share due any deceased child divided equally among that child’s descendants</li>
<li>If none, to your parents equally or to your surviving parent</li>
<li>If none, to the appointed executor or administrator of your estate</li>
<li>If none, to your next of kin who is entitled to your estate under the laws of the state in which you resided at the time of your death</li>
</ol>

Otherwise, you’ll want to complete [Form TSP-3](#), _Designation of Beneficiary_. The easiest way to do this is to use the online “wizard,” which you’ll find by logging into My Account and selecting “Beneficiaries” on the left.

If you don’t remember whether you’ve submitted a Form TSP-3 or you’re not sure who you named as your beneficiaries, look at your annual statement, check the online wizard, or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778.  Even if you’re certain your designated beneficiaries are current, check them periodically. You may need to make changes if you’ve had a change in your family such as a birth, death, divorce, or marriage.
