# Your account number

Your 13-digit account number is the primary means of identifying your TSP account. Use this number when accessing your account online, when calling the ThriftLine, or when completing TSP forms.

Once you’ve logged into your account, you can create a customized **user ID** to use instead of your account number for online transactions.

If you have both a civilian and a uniformed services account, both accounts are identified by the same account number. You can go into each of your accounts and assign them the same user IDs.

If you forget your account number, you can call the ThriftLine to request to have it mailed to you, or you can find it on your quarterly and annual participant statements. To help protect your account information, you cannot receive this number via email or over the telephone.

## How to gain access to my account

To log in to [My Account](#), enter your 13-digit TSP account number, which was mailed to you, **or** your user ID that you created and your web password.

Your password will either be the one mailed to you, a temporary password that a Participant Service Representative (PSR) provided to you, or the one you created when you logged into your account. The first time you log into your account, you’ll be prompted to create a new password of your choice.

Once you’re in, you'll be securely connected to all your account information.

You also can access your account information via the [ThriftLine](/contact/) by using the 4-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN), which was mailed to you.
