## What is my account number?
  <p>Your 13-digit account number is the primary means of identifying your TSP account. Use this number when accessing your account online, when calling the ThriftLine, or when completing TSP forms.</p>
  <p>Once you have logged into your account on the website, you can create a customized <span class="bold">user ID</span> to use instead of your account number for online transactions.</p>
  <p>If you have both a civilian and a uniformed services account, the same account number is used to identify both accounts. You can go into each of your accounts and assign them the same user IDs.</p>
  <p>If you forget your account number, you can use the TSP website or the ThriftLine to request to have it mailed to you. You can also find your account number on your quarterly and annual participant statements.</p>

<!-- <h2>How do I log in to My Account?</h2>
  <p>To log in to <a href="/tsp/accountBalance.do?subaction=view&amp;\_name=acctbal">My Account</a>, enter your 13-digit TSP account number, which was mailed to you, or your user ID that you created and your web password. </p>

  <p>Your password will either be the one mailed to you, a temporary password that a Participant Service Representative (PSR) provided to you, or one you created when you logged into your account. The first time you log into your account, you will be prompted to create a new password of your choice.</p>

  <p> Once you’re in, you'll be securely connected to all your account information.</p> -->

## How do I move money into the TSP?

Whether you are currently a civilian employee, a member of the uniformed services, or a separated participant, you can move money from other eligible plans to your TSP account.

We require the following:

<ul>
<li>You have an existing TSP account. You cannot open a TSP account by transferring money into it.</li>
<li>The money that you intend to move is considered an "eligible rollover distribution" for federal income tax purposes. Check with the administrator of the plan or IRA from which you are moving the money or a tax advisor if you are unsure.</li>
</ul>

  <p>We <span class="bold">will accept</span> both transfers and rollovers of tax-deferred money from traditional IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and eligible employer plans such as a 401(k) or 403(b) into the <span class="bold">traditional balance</span> of your account.</p>

  <p>We <span class="bold">will accept</span> only transfers (i.e., direct rollovers) of qualified and non-qualified Roth distributions from Roth 401(k)s, Roth 403(b)s, and Roth 457(b)s into the <span class="bold">Roth balance</span> of your account. If you don't already have a Roth balance in your existing TSP account, the transfer will create one.</p>

  <p>We <span class="bold">will not accept</span> Roth rollovers that have already been paid to you and <span class="bold">will not accept</span> transfers or rollovers from Roth IRAs.</p>

### How to Move Money into Your TSP Account

#### Transfer Money Directly into the TSP

  <p>If your traditional IRA or eligible employer plan sends all or part of your money to the TSP, this is called a "transfer" or a "direct rollover." Use <a href="/PDF/forms/tsp-60.pdf" class="pdfLink" title="PDF file opens in new tab">Form TSP-60</a>, <span class="italic">Request for a Transfer Into the TSP</span>, for tax-deferred amounts. To transfer Roth money, use <a href="/PDF/forms/tsp-60-r.pdf" class="pdfLink" title="PDF file opens in new tab">Form TSP-60-R</a>, <span class="italic">Request for a Roth Transfer Into the TSP</span>.</p>

#### Roll Over Traditional Money into the TSP

  <p>If you receive money directly from your traditional IRA or plan and then you later put it into your TSP account, this is called a "rollover." You cannot roll over Roth money into the TSP and you must complete your rollover within 60 days from the date you receive your funds. Use <a href="/PDF/forms/tsp-60.pdf" class="pdfLink" title="PDF file opens in new tab">Form TSP-60</a>, <span class="italic">Request for a Transfer Into the TSP</span>, to roll over traditional money.</p>

  <p>The money that you transfer or roll over to the TSP does not count towards the IRC contribution limits, so there is no restriction on the amount of money you can move. Your transfer or rollover will be invested according to your latest contribution allocation on file.</p>

### Tax Considerations

  <p>Tax rules differ depending upon which method you choose to move your IRA or eligible plan money into the TSP.</p>

#### Transfers

  <p>You do not have to pay taxes on the money you transfer in immediately. However, depending on the type of money you transfer, you may be subject to pay income taxes when you withdraw your TSP account. For more information, see the TSP tax notice "<a href="javascript:void(0)">Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account</a>."</p>

  <h4>Rollovers</h4>

  <p>If you rollover money, you will have 60 days from the date you receive the funds to complete the transaction.</p>

  <p>You may roll over all or part of the money you receive. Your traditional IRA or former plan should withhold the appropriate amount for taxes before it sends the money to you. Otherwise, if you roll over your entire balance, you will have to make up the difference (i.e., the amount withheld for taxes) from your own funds. Any amount that you do not roll over may be subject to federal income tax and it may also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty tax.</p>

## How do I protect my account against fraud?

As a TSP participant, you should know how to protect your account against various types of fraud. Private parties offering assistance with your TSP account, including third party mobile apps, have not been approved, endorsed, sponsored, or authorized by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which is the independent government agency that administers the TSP.

If you are unsure whether correspondence or telephone calls claiming to be from the TSP are authentic, <span class="bold">DO NOT</span> provide any personal or financial information to them. If you have questions or if you need to report any suspicious activity involving your TSP account, call us at 1-877-968-3778 and choose option 3 to speak to a Participant Service Representative.
