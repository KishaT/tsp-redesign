## What type of investor am I?

Think about the type of investor you are.

If you are looking for a simple, low maintenance way of investing money in your TSP account, consider
investing in an  <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/index.html">L Fund</a>. The L Funds make the investing process easy for you because you do not have to figure out how to diversify your account or how and when to rebalance. The investment mix of each L Fund automatically becomes more conservative as its target date approaches.

If you get anxious with every dip in the market, consider an investment, such as the <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_G.html">G Fund</a>, that places a higher priority on stability than on the opportunity to achieve significant long-term growth.

If you are willing to tolerate fluctuations in your account value in exchange for the possibility of higher returns over time, then consider introducing higher <span data-term="volatility" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">volatility</span> funds, such as the <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_C.html">C Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_S.html">S Fund</a>, and <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_I.html">I Fund</a>, to your
retirement portfolio.
