<h2>How much should I contribute?</h2>
<p>When contributing to your retirement, make sure you’re not leaving money on the table. By  contributing at least 5% of your pay, you’re taking full advantage of thousands of dollars in matching funds from your agency or service over time.</p>

<h2 id="section-heading-1">Here’s how it works</h2>
<p>On top of your salary or basic pay, your agency or service<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> will also contribute up to 5% of your pay to your TSP account each paycheck. You only get the full amount if you contribute at least 5%.</p>

<div class="usa-alert usa-alert-info" >
  <div class="usa-alert-body"><h3 class="usa-alert-heading">How to change your contribution amount</h3><p class="usa-alert-text">You must use your electronic payroll system (e.g. <a href="https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx" target="\_blank">myPay</a>, EBIS, <a href="https://www.nfc.usda.gov/EPPS/eplogin.aspx" target="\_blank">NFC EPP</a>, <a href="https://liteblue.usps.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/z1/jY9NC4JAEIZ_SweP60zaF92kQxF9EGLaXEJhWxfWXdHV6N8ndSiir7m9M8888AJBAqTTVorUSqNT1eUDjY6zebAYjFeIW2-P6G2G4Q6j0Md1H-IbgB8mQKB__r8A9F0fA_1ClkBCmezeJtCZPxFAFT_xilduU3Xr3NqynjrooJKWZ6rhbsEfgSkjpGZGK6k5a-qyZi8nYVoH3-lzU1tInqxQFlGCjLLLOehdAUrfAgc!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/" target="\_blank">LiteBlue</a> and <a href="https://www.employeeexpress.gov/Default.aspx" target="\_blank">Employee Express</a>) or complete <a href="#">Form TSP-1</a> or <a href="#">Form TSP-U-1</a>.</p></div>

<h2 id="section-heading-2">Here’s an example:</h2>
<p>For someone making $50,000 annually, 5% is about $95 a paycheck. With your contributions and the full matching from your agency or service, you could accumulate more than $190,000<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> in savings over 20 years. In 30 years, you could earn over $400,000<a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Estimates assume 5% in Agency/Service Matching Contributions and a rate of return of 6% compounded monthly over time.</p>
<p>Take a look at how your savings grow when you maximize your contributions. Find out how much more you can save by taking advantage of your agency's 5% matching funds below.</p>

<h2>What's the difference between saving 3% vs 5%?</h2>

<span style="font-size: 75%; margin-top: 2em;"><sup id="fn1">1</sup>Applies to service members who have opted into the Blended Retirement System.<br />
<sup id="fn2">2</sup>Includes matching contributions and assumes a 6% rate of return compounded monthly.<br />
<sup id="fn3">3</sup>Includes matching contributions and assumes a 6% rate of return compounded monthly.

<h2>What type of investor am I?</h2>
<p>Think about the type of investor you are.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple, low maintenance way of investing money in your TSP account, consider
investing in an  <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/index.html">L Fund</a>. The L Funds make the investing process easy for you because you do not have to figure out how to diversify your account or how and when to rebalance. The investment mix of each L Fund automatically becomes more conservative as its target date approaches.</p>

<p>If you get anxious with every dip in the market, consider an investment, such as the <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_G.html">G Fund</a>, that places a higher priority on stability than on the opportunity to achieve significant long-term growth.</p>

<p>If you are willing to tolerate fluctuations in your account value in exchange for the possibility of higher returns over time, then consider introducing higher <span data-term="volatility" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">volatility</span> funds, such as the <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_C.html">C Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_S.html">S Fund</a>, and <a href="https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_I.html">I Fund</a>, to your
retirement portfolio.</p>
