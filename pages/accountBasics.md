    <h1>Account basics</h1>
    <p>The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal employees and members of the uniformed services, including the Ready Reserve.</p>

    <h2>What is My Account?</h2>
      <p>The secure, convenient section of tsp.gov where you can log in to find out your account balance or
      perform certain transactions. Access My Account any time to make sure youâ€™re on track to meet your retirement goals:</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Account Overview:</span> View your recent transactions and activity summary.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Statements:</span> View or download past or current quarterly and annual participant statements.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Profile settings:</span>  Update your personal and account access information; validate your contact info.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Contribution allocations:</span>  Change how you want to invest future money coming into your account.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Interfund transfers:</span>  Redistribute all or part of your existing TSP account among the different TSP
      funds.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Secure messaging:</span>  Send a message to one of our Participant Service Representatives. We will
      respond to your inquiry within 24 business hours.</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Apply for a Loan:</span></p>
      <p><span class="bold">Request a Withdrawal:</span></p>

    <h2>What is my account number?</h2>
      <p>Your 13-digit <span class="bold">account number</span> is the primary means of identifying your TSP account. Use this number when accessing your account online, when calling the ThriftLine, or when completing TSP forms.</p>
      <p>Once you have logged into your account on the website, you can create a customized <span class="bold">user ID</span> to use instead of your account number for online transactions.</p>
      <p>If you have both a civilian and a uniformed services account, the same account number is used to identify both accounts. You can go into each of your accounts and assign them the same user IDs. If you forget your account number, you can use the TSP website or the ThriftLine to request to have it mailed to you. You can also find your account number on your quarterly and annual participant statements.</p>
