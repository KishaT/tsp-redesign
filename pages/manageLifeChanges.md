{:#address}
## How do I change my address?

How you change your address with us depends on whether or not you still work for the federal government

If you’re currently a federal employee, you must report your correct address to your agency or service. We can’t accept address changes directly from you.

If you’re no longer a federal employee, log into the My Account section of tsp.gov, visit “<a href="javascript:void(0)">Profile Settings,</a>,” and review and change the address listed there. Or while you’re logged in, you can use our online wizard to complete <a href="javascript:void(0)">Form TSP-9</a>, Change in Address for Separated Participants. You can also fax or mail it to us.

If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, you can update your address through the <a href="https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx" target="\_blank">myPay</a> website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.

{:#beneficiaries}
## Beneficiary basics

If you’d like your TSP account to be distributed according to the statutory order of precedence, you don’t have to do anything. In the event of your death, your TSP account would be paid as follows:

<ol>
<li>To your spouse</li>
<li>If none, to your child or children equally, with the share due any deceased child divided equally among that child’s descendants</li>
<li>If none, to your parents equally or to your surviving parent</li>
<li>If none, to the appointed executor or administrator of your estate</li>
<li>If none, to your next of kin who is entitled to your estate under the laws of the state in which you resided at the time of your death</li>
</ol>

Otherwise, you’ll want to complete [Form TSP-3](#), _Designation of Beneficiary_. The easiest way to do this is to use the online “wizard,” which you’ll find by logging into My Account and selecting “Beneficiaries” on the left.

If you don’t remember whether you’ve submitted a Form TSP-3 or you’re not sure who you named as your beneficiaries, look at your annual statement, check the online wizard, or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778.  Even if you’re certain your designated beneficiaries are current, check them periodically. You may need to make changes if you’ve had a change in your family such as a birth, death, divorce, or marriage.

{:#leaving}
## Leaving Federal Service
If your account balance is $200 or more, you can leave it in the TSP when you leave federal service——and continue to enjoy earnings and low administrative expenses. Once you leave federal service, you’ll no longer be able to make employee contributions. However, you can transfer money into your TSP account from traditional IRAs and other eligible employer plans. Your account will continue to accrue earnings, and you’ll still be able to change the way your money is invested in the TSP funds by making interfund transfers.

If you’re separating from federal service, there are four important things you must do:

1. Make sure the TSP has your current address at all times.
2. If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
3. Read the booklet Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service so that you fully understand your options.
4. Read the tax notice "Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account."

{:#nonpay}
## Entering a nonpay status

### What is nonpay status?

Nonpay status is when active federal government employees, including the uniformed services, do not receiving regular pay because of furlough, suspension, leave without pay (including leave without pay to perform military duty).

Here are some things you can expect while you’re in nonpay status:

### What stays the same?

* You can continue to make interfund transfers (IFTs). You can also make contribution allocation changes that will take effect once you return to pay status, or when you make future loan payments to your account.
* You can transfer or roll over money into your TSP account from traditional IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and eligible employer plans.
* You can request a financial hardship or age-based in-service withdrawal, if you are eligible.

### What changes?

#### All Accounts
* You will not be able to contribute because your employee contributions are made through payroll deductions.
* You will not be eligible to request a new TSP loan.

#### Uniformed Services Accounts

* If you are a civilian employee in nonpay status to perform military service, you may make contributions to your uniformed services account from your uniformed services pay.
* You will not receive Agency Contributions in your uniformed services account, but when you return to civilian pay status, you may be entitled to make up TSP contributions to your civilian account (and receive restored Agency Contributions, if you are a FERS employee).
* If you are a BRS participant, you will receive Service Automatic (1%) Contributions and Service Matching Contributions, if eligible. Your reclaimed agency contributions to your civilian account will be reduced accordingly.

For more information, read the fact sheet _[TSP Benefits That Apply to Members of the Military Who Return to Federal Civilian Service](javascript:void())_.

#### FERS Employee Accounts

* You will not receive <span data-term="Agency Matching Contributions" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">Agency Matching Contributions</span> (which are based on your employee contributions).

* You will not receive <span data-term="Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions" class="js-glossary-toggle term term-end">Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions</span>, which are calculated on basic pay earned each pay period.

### What are the effects of nonpay status on my contributions and loans?

* If you make employee contributions based on a **percentage** of your basic pay and your income decreases during the pay period, your contributions would automatically decrease by an equal percentage. However, if you make contributions based on a **dollar amount**, that amount would not automatically decrease with the reduction in pay.
* If you don’t earn enough per pay period for your agency to deduct the required loan payment from your pay because of a furlough, you would be responsible for ensuring your TSP loan payments are up to date.

For in-depth information on short-term and long-term effects of a government shutdown or furlough, read our fact sheets, _[Sequestration and Your TSP Account and Effect of Nonpay Status on Your TSP Account](javascript:void())_.
