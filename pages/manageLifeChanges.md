<h2>How do I change my address?</h2>

<p>How you change your address with us depends on whether or not you still work for the federal government.</p>

<p>If you’re currently a federal employee, you must report your correct address to your agency or service. We can’t accept address changes directly from you.</p>

<p>If you’re no longer a federal employee, log into the My Account section of tsp.gov, visit “<a href="javascript:void(0)">Profile Settings,</a>,” and review and change the address listed there. Or while you’re logged in, you can use our online wizard to complete <a href="javascript:void(0)">Form TSP-9</a>, Change in Address for Separated Participants. You can also fax or mail it to us.</p>

<p>If you’re an active duty uniformed services member, you can update your address through the <a href="https://mypay.dfas.mil/mypay.aspx" target="\_blank">myPay</a> website. Just make sure that you log in and go to the TSP section to change your TSP address. If you change it in the “Correspondence Address” section of myPay, it will not change your TSP address.</p>

<h2>How do I update my beneficiaries?</h2>

<p>If you’d like your TSP account to be distributed according to the statutory order of precedence, you don’t have to do anything. In the event of your death, your TSP account would be paid as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>To your spouse</li>
<li>If none, to your child or children equally, with the share due any deceased child divided equally among that child’s descendants</li>
<li>If none, to your parents equally or to your surviving parent</li>
<li>If none, to the appointed executor or administrator of your estate</li>
<li>If none, to your next of kin who is entitled to your estate under the laws of the state in which you resided at the time of your death</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, you’ll want to complete Form TSP-3, Designation of Beneficiary. The easiest way to do this is to use the online “wizard,” which you’ll find by logging into My Account and selecting “Beneficiaries” on the left.</p>

<p>If you don’t remember whether you’ve submitted a Form TSP-3 or you’re not sure who you named as your beneficiaries, look at your annual statement, check the online wizard, or call the ThriftLine at 1-877-968-3778.  Even if you’re certain your designated beneficiaries are current, check them periodically. You may need to make changes if you’ve had a change in your family such as a birth, death, divorce, or marriage.</p>
