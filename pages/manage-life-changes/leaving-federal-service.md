## Leaving Federal Service
If your account balance is $200 or more, you can leave it in the TSP when you leave federal service——and continue to enjoy earnings and low administrative expenses. Once you leave federal service, you’ll no longer be able to make employee contributions. However, you can transfer money into your TSP account from traditional IRAs and other eligible employer plans. Your account will continue to accrue earnings, and you’ll still be able to change the way your money is invested in the TSP funds by making interfund transfers.

If you’re separating from federal service, there are four important things you must do:

1. Make sure the TSP has your current address at all times.
2. If you have any TSP loans, pay them off within 90 days of your separation.
3. Read the booklet Withdrawing Your TSP Account After Leaving Federal Service so that you fully understand your options.
4. Read the tax notice "Important Tax Information About Payments From Your TSP Account."
