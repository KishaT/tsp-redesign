<h2>What should I know about being a beneficiary participant?</h2>

<p>As a beneficiary participant, you will not be able to make contributions to, borrow from, or transfer money into your beneficiary participant account; however, we offer a number of other great features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low administrative and investment expenses that can increase your savings potential</li>
  <li>Tax-deferred growth of earnings on traditional contributions </li>
  <li>Tax-deferred growth of earnings on Roth contributions (which are tax-free when withdrawn if IRS requirements are met) </li>
  <li>The ability to combine your beneficiary account with your existing civilian or uniformed services TSP account, if you have one </li>
  <li>A diversified choice of <a href="javascript:void(0)">investment options</a></li>
  <li>You can leave your money in the TSP, or choose from several withdrawal options.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get the most out of the TSP, you need to make several important decisions about your account. Reading the booklet, <a href="/PDF/forms/tspbk32.pdf" class="pdfLink" title="PDF file opens in new tab"><span class="italic">Managing Your Account for Beneficiary Participants</span></a>, will help you get started.
