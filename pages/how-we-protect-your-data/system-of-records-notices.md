# System of records notices (SORNS)

The Privacy Act of 1974 requires all federal agencies to publish a formal notice to the public in the Federal Register that identifies the purposes for which personally identifiable information (PII) is collected; how the PII is used by the Agency; how the Agency shares PII externally; and, most importantly, how individuals can access and correct the information a federal government agency maintains on the subject individual. These notices are called System of Records Notices (SORNs).

FRTIB is required to publish a SORN anytime it creates, substantially modifies, or retires a system of records. A system of records is a collection of records under the control of a federal agency from which information about a specific individual can be retrieved or accessed by a unique personal identifier (e.g., name or account number).

FRTIB has the following systems of records:

| Header One     | Header Two     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |
