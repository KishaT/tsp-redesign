    <h1>Beneficiary basics</h1>
    <p>The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings and investment plan for Federal employees and members of the uniformed services, including the Ready Reserve.</p>

    <h2>How do I add a beneficiary?</h2>
    <p>It was established by Congress in the Federal Employeesâ€™ Retirement System Act of 1986 and offers the same types of savings and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under 401(k) plans.</p>

    <h2>How do I change a beneficiary?</h2>
    <p>The TSP is a defined contribution plan, meaning that the retirement income you receive from your TSP account will depend on how much you (and your agency, if you are eligible to receive agency contributions) put into your account during your working years and the earnings accumulated over that time.</p>

    <h2>What is the Statutory Order of Precedence?</h2>
    <p>If you are covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), the TSP is one part of a three-part retirement package that also includes your FERS basic annuity and Social Security.</p>

    <h2>What is different about my beneficiary account?</h2>
    <p>If you are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or are a member of the uniformed services, the TSP is a supplement to your CSRS annuity or military retired pay.</p>
