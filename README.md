# Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board - Thrift Savings Plan (tsp.gov)

### About the prototype

* The prototype uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a Ruby-based static site generator. For more information about using Jekyll, refer to the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

* The prototype is also built with the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov), a set of reusable, high-quality components for modern websites. We're using the Web Design System [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll) with some customized styles.

### Running prototype locally

After cloning the repo, navigate to the correct folder and install Jekyll and any necessary dependencies using:
```
cd tsp-uswds/sandbox
```

```
npm install
```

```
bundle install
```

To run the site locally, from the `sandbox` folder, run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If all goes well, visit the site at `http://localhost:4000`.
